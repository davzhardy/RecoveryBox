RecoveryBox is a mobile app aimed to help people in their journeys through twelve-step recovery programmes such as Alcoholics Anonymous. The app is a tool for people to document their meeting attendance, moods and the difficulties they encounter in their day-to-day lives. 

It documents the efforts made by programme participants and encourages continuing, sustainable interaction and self-reflection to stay on top of their recovery.
